# How To Set Up GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a ready-to-use cloud environment for this training. Participants can start coding immediately without local installation.

## What's Inside

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `notebooks/` | Training notebooks used during sessions |
| `data/` | Example data for exercises |
| `.devcontainer/` | Codespaces container configuration |

## Before The Session: Avoid Unexpected Charges

GitHub Codespaces is free up to a monthly allowance: 120 core-hours of compute and 15 GB-month of storage on a Free account; 180 core-hours and 20 GB-month on Pro. A typical training session on the default 2-core machine consumes a small fraction of this. The risk isn't the session itself, but a codespace left running, or simply left undeleted, after the training ends.

If you have a GitHub Pro account with a payment method on file, exceeding the free tier can result in charges. On a Free account (or any account without a payment method), GitHub blocks usage instead of charging.

To make sure this training costs you nothing, do these three things on your account *before* you create the codespace:

1. Set a spending limit of \$0: Go to [github.com/settings/billing/budgets](https://github.com/settings/billing/budgets) and confirm Codespaces is set to \$0. This is the default for new accounts but worth checking.
2. Set the default idle timeout to 30 minutes: Go to [github.com/settings/codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) and set the default idle timeout to 30 minutes. This ensures the codespace auto-stops if you walk away.
3. Set the default retention period to 7 days: In the same page, set the default retention period to 7 days. This means if you forget to delete the codespace, it will auto-delete after a week, freeing up your storage quota.

After the session, you can also manually delete the codespace at [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) by clicking the `...` next to your codespace and selecting `Delete`. This is the best way to ensure you won't be charged for unused resources.

## Create A New Codespace

1. Open the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the green Code button.
3. Open the Codespaces tab.
4. Click Create codespace on main.
5. Leave the default 2-core machine type selected.
6. Wait for the container to build and open in VS Code for the web. The first build takes a few minutes.

The environment is set up automatically: system libraries and Python packages are installed during the build, and this repository package is installed from source after the container starts. You do not need to run any setup commands yourself.

## Run Notebooks

1. Open the `notebooks/` folder in the file explorer.
2. Open the notebook assigned by the training lead.
3. Select the Python 3 kernel when prompted.
4. Run cells from top to bottom.

## Add More Packages

Add packages to [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) under `dependencies`, then run `uv sync` and rebuild the Codespace:

- Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P
- Codespaces: Rebuild Container

## Common Troubleshooting

- First build takes too long: this is normal on initial startup; reload and reopen if needed.
- Package install fails: rerun `uv sync` and check internet/proxy settings.
- Kernel issues in notebooks: restart the kernel and rerun cells in order.
- Wrong repository version: verify your branch in the bottom-left status bar.
